**hungrycat** [-f] [-P] [-s *BLOCK_SIZE*] *FILE*...

Description
-----------
**hungrycat** is a tool that prints contents of a file on the standard output,
while simultaneously freeing disk space occupied by the file.

It can be useful if you need to process a large file, but:

- you don't have enough space to store the output file and
- you wouldn't need the input file afterwards.

Options
-------

-f               Force processing even if the file has multiple links.

-P               Use fallocate() with FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, instead of
                 shuffling the file contents and using ftruncate(). This might
                 ease file recovery if the program was interrupted in the
                 middle of processing.

                 If the fallocate() system call is not supported by the
                 underlying filesystem the program will fall back to the
                 “classic” implementation. You can disable the fall-back
                 behavior by specifying the option twice.

-s BLOCK_SIZE    Set block size to *BLOCK_SIZE* (default: @BUFSIZ@).
